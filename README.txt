This is a sample Sugar 7 dashlet that renders an iframe using the current record context. The specific example is doing a Duck Duck Go search on the name of the current record, rendering it in the dashlet as an iFrame.

You can take this, zip it up, and install it in your Sugar 7 instance. But mostly, it's designed as a starting point for building your own Sugar 7 iFrame dashlet.

Enjoy!
